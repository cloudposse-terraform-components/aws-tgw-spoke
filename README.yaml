  This component is responsible for provisioning [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway) attachments
  to connect VPCs in a `spoke` account to different accounts through a central `hub`.

usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to configure and use this component:

  stacks/catalog/tgw/spoke.yaml

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw/spoke-defaults:
        metadata:
          type: abstract
          component: tgw/spoke
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: tgw-spoke
          tags:
            Team: sre
            Service: tgw-spoke
          expose_eks_sg: false
          tgw_hub_tenant_name: core
          tgw_hub_environment_name: ue1

      tgw/spoke:
        metadata:
          inherits:
            - tgw/spoke-defaults
        vars:
          # This is what THIS spoke is allowed to connect to.
          # since this is deployed to each plat account (dev->prod),
          # we allow connections to network and auto.
          connections:
            - account:
                tenant: core
                stage: network
              # Set this value if the vpc component has a different name in this account
              vpc_component_names:
                - vpc-dev
            - account:
                tenant: core
                stage: auto
  ```

  stacks/ue2/dev.yaml

  ```yaml
  import:
    - catalog/tgw/spoke

  components:
    terraform:
      tgw/spoke:
        vars:
          # use when there is not an EKS cluster in the stack
          expose_eks_sg: false
          # override default connections
          connections:
            - account:
                tenant: core
                stage: network
              vpc_component_names:
                - vpc-dev
            - account:
                tenant: core
                stage: auto
            - account:
                tenant: plat
                stage: dev
              eks_component_names:
                - eks/cluster
            - account:
                tenant: plat
                stage: qa
              eks_component_names:
                - eks/cluster
  ```

  To provision the attachments for a spoke account:

  ```sh
  atmos terraform plan tgw/spoke -s <tenant>-<environment>-<stage>
  atmos terraform apply tgw/spoke -s <tenant>-<environment>-<stage>
  ```
